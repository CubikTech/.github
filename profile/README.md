### 📫 Contact Us

If you want to contact us, the most efficient way is to send emails to us. We will check our inbox every 4 to 5 hours, so you should get our response pretty quickly unless the mail system moves your message to the junk box, which we usually will clear directly after a quick check every week (so it's possible that we can't even see your email before it got deleted).
